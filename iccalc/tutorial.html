    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <p>
     Note: this tutorial doesn't stand alone. It will be much clearer after a
     reading of the defining paper on C+,
     <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">Nonmonotonic
     Causal Theories</a> by Giunchiglia, Lee, Lifschitz, McCain and Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
     The example action description
     <a href="./examples/cornucopia">cornucopia</a>
     contains examples of all input syntax accepted by iCCalc.
     If you are not sure how to write something, or what a given bit
     of syntax means, the answer is probably there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The running example here concerns the letter-writing activities of
     the New England Transcendentalists
     (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism">?</a>).
     For more examples of iCCalc input syntax, see the files:
     <a href="./examples/library">library</a>,
     <a href="./examples/light">light</a>,
     <a href="./examples/monkey">monkey</a>,
     <a href="./examples/rooms">rooms</a>,
     <a href="./examples/russianChambers">russianChambers</a> and
     <a href="./examples/russianND">russianND</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Running iCCalc</h3>
    <p>
     After <a href="./download.html">installation</a>, iCCalc can be run
     using the script 'iccalc'. This accepts a number of command-line
     options:
    </p>
    <table>
     <tr><td>-yap</td><td>use YAP Prolog, if installed</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-s4</td><td>use SICStus Prolog 4, if installed</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-s3</td><td>use SICStus Prolog 3, if installed</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-o &lt;FILE&gt;</td><td>load the option file &lt;FILE&gt;</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-mcluca</td><td>also compile mcLUCA</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-a &lt;FILE&gt;</td><td>if compiling mcLUCA, use &lt;FILE&gt; as definitions for annotations</td></tr>
     <tr><td>-na</td><td>if compiling mcLUCA, do not load an annotations definition file</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
     All additional command-line arguments are deemed to be action description
     source files. So, if the current working directory had an action description
     source file 'monkey', I could type
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% iccalc monkey
     <br /><br />
     to start Prolog, compile iccalc, and then load the 'monkey' action
     description.
    </p>
    <h3>Action Description Source Files</h3>
    <p>
     Action descriptions of the language C+ (see the paper
     <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">Nonmonotonic
     Causal Theories</a> by Giunchiglia, Lee, Lifschitz, McCain and Turner)
     define labelled transition systems. Accordingly, the input files to
     iCCalc are specifications of C+ action descriptions, where the syntax is
     very close to C+, but with a number of convenient extra features to
     allowing concision in the specifications. In addition, action description
     source files can contain definitions of queries, questions that iCCalc
     can answer about runs through the transition system. (We will call the
     source files 'action descriptions' where this doesn't introduce
     confusion.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The labelled transition systems defined by a C+ action description are
     graphs, whose nodes represent states of the system being modelled,
     and whose edges represent the possible transitions between states.
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as supporting action descriptions of C+, iCCalc also supports
     action descriptions of that language's various extensions, including
     nC+, pC+, and their combination npC+. The syntax of the source files
     for these various languages is described below. Note that all of the
     various extensions use the common elements of source files for C+.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action descriptions can be loaded using 'loadf( )' from within iCCalc
     or mcLUCA. The predicate reloadf/0 reloads a current version of
     whichever files are currently loaded.
    </p>
    <h3>Signatures</h3>
    <p>
     The signatures of C+ action descriptions are multi-valued and
     propositional, and are divided into 'fluent constants' and 'action
     constants'. Fluent constants are used to describe properties of
     objects and the environment; the values given to fluent constants
     determine what state the system is in. Action constants are used to
     represent the actions and events, and properties of them, that can
     occur in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
     As an example, we will consider a domain where two agents,
     Emerson and Thoreau, can move between two locations, Harvard and Walden.
     Emerson and Thoreau can be pleased or not, and their emotional state can
     either be turbulent, or not. As well as moving between locations, they
     can write to one another. There are six fluent constants, which can be
     specified as follows:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fc(loc(A)) :- agent(A).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fc(pleased(A)) :- agent(A).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fc(turbulent(A)) :- agent(A).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agent(emerson).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agent(thoreau).<br />
     <br />
     Fluent constants can be Boolean or not. If they are Boolean, there is no
     need to declare their domain, but if they are non-Boolean, then it is
     necessary to say what values the constants can take. The constants
     'pleased( )' and 'turbulent( )' are Boolean: an agent is either pleased
     or not, and turbulent or not. The constant 'loc( )' is non-Boolean, and
     we declare its domain thus:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(loc(A), L) :- agent(A), location(L).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location(harvard).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location(walden).<br />
     <br />
     The action constants and their domains are specified as follows:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ac(A^move) :- agent(A).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ac(A^writeTo^A1) :- agent(A), agent(A1), A \= A1.<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(A^move, L) :- agent(A), location(L).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(A^move, ff) :- agent(A).<br />
     <br />
     The domain declarations for 'move' mean that an agent can either move
     to a location, or else not move at all (stand still).
    </p>
    <p>
     Statically-determined fluent constants are declared using facts of
     the predicate sdfc/1, along the same lines as fc/1, above.
    </p>
    <p>
     The predicates agent/1 and location/1, above, are user-defined. iCCalc
     allows the user to use arbitrary Prolog clauses in the definitions of
     signatures, causal laws and queries. This increases the concision of
     action description source files. (Another source of concision is
     the use of variables: see below.)
    </p>
    <h3>Causal Laws</h3>
    <p>
     Causal laws in C+ are of three types: static, dynamic, and action.
     There are a number of abbreviations for commonly-used forms of the
     various kinds of law.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is common to declare all or some fluent constants as inertial: the
     values of these fluent constants persist, by default, as the system
     changes. In our example action description, we have:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inertial(FC) :- fc(FC).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exogenous(AC) :- ac(FC).<br />
     <br />
     The 'exogenous' declaration means that action constants can take on any
     value in a transition (unless prevented from doing so by other causal
     laws).
     <br />
     The other causal laws of the action description are:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused loc(A)=L after A^move=L :- agent(A), location(L).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonexecutable A^move=L if loc(A)=L :- agent(A), location(L).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused pleased(A1) after A^writeTo^A1 :- agent(A), agent(A1), A \= A1.<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused -turbulent(A) after A^writeTo^A1 :- agent(A), agent(A1), A \= A1.<br />
     <br />
     The first law states that the location of an agent is L, after the agent
     moves to that location. The second states that an agent cannot move to
     a location if he is already there. The third law states that an agent
     is pleased after somebody else writes to him. The fourth states that
     an agent is no longer turbulent after he has written to someone else.
    </p>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>
     The repeated presence of 'agent(A)' and 'location(L)' in the bodies of
     the clauses above can be avoided by declaring variables in the source
     file. These have the form
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;VARS&gt; :: L1,...,Ln.<br />
     <br />
     Where &lt;VARS&gt; is a number of variables separated by commas, with a
     'head variable' first. For example, in our example action description
     we can declare:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A,A1 :: agent(A).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L,L1 :: location(L).<br />
     <br />
     Now, whenever a variable 'A' appears elsewhere in the source file,
     the clause in which it appears will be partially grounded by every
     value of 'A' for which 'agent(A)' is true. The same will be applied
     to every other variable after 'A' in the list: so that if 'A1' appears
     in the source file, it will also be grounded to every agent.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means, for instance, that instead of the first clause declaring
     the 'loc( )' fluent constant, above, we can simply write:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fc(loc(A)).<br />
     <br />
     The domain can be specified by:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(loc(A), L).<br />
     <br />
     The full action description for the example so far is
     <a href="./examples/emerson01">emerson01</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>User-Defined Queries</h3>
    <p>
     Given an action description, to query iCCalcc is to ask it to find runs
     through the labelled transition system defined by the action description
     that are consistent with information passed in the query. This
     information states what must be true at various points during the run.
    </p>
    <p>
     The predicate query/3 is used to specify queries in source files.
     The first argument is an identifier, which can be any Prolog term,
     for the query. The second is the length of the runs which will be
     considered in solving the query. The third argument is a list
     specifying what must be true of the run. Here is an example:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query(eh, 1, [0:(emerson^move)=harvard]).<br />
     <br />
     This query defines the transitions (runs of length of 1) where Emerson
     goes to Harvard: where the action constant 'emerson^move' has the
     value 'harvard' at time 0. Another example:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query(bp, 1, [-(0:pleased(emerson)),<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-(0:pleased(thoreau)),<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1:pleased(emerson),<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1:pleased(thoreau)]).<br />
     <br />
     This query defines transitions from states where neither is pleased,
     to states where both agents are pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
     These queries could be saved in the same source file as the action
     description, and loaded with it, but in this example we keep them in
     a separate file,
     <a href="./examples/emerson01queries">emerson01queries</a>. They
     can be loaded, together with the action description, by typing:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% iccalc emerson01 emerson01queries<br />
     <br />
     After loading, the first query can be answered by typing at the Prolog
     prompt:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- query eh.<br />
     <br />
     This will produce as output all runs through the labelled transition
     system defined by the action description that are consistent with
     the query information.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of keeping queries in the source files, they can also be posed
     on-the-fly using the query/2 predicate. This does the same work as
     query/3, but with the first argument omitted. So after loading the
     'emerson01' action description, it is possible to type at the Prolog
     prompt:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- query(1, [0:(emerson^move)=harvard]).<br />
     <br />
     This then does exactly the same as 'query eh'.
    </p>
    <p>
     The argument of query/2 and query/3 that specifies the length of
     run to be considered in solving the query can also denote a range,
     m..n, where m &lt; n. iCCalc will then try to solve the query for
     runs of length m; if it fails, it will consider runs of length m+1; and
     so on, up to n. In that case the prefix 'max:' can be
     used instead of an integer to specify fluents that must be true in
     the final state of the run. For example:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- query(2..4, [0:(loc(emerson)=harvard),<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max:(loc(emerson)=harvard)]).<br />
     <br />
     This defines runs of length 2--4 where Emerson is initially in Harvard,
     and is in Walden at the end of the run. Since there is such a run of
     length 2, iCCalc would output all runs of length 2 that satisfy the
     constraints, and then stop, without considering the runs of length 3
     and 4.
    </p>
    <p>
     Prolog can occur in the body of query/3 clauses. For example:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query(x, 1, List) :- findall(0:loc(X)=harvard, agent(X), List).<br />
    </p>
    <h3>Built-In Queries</h3>
    <p>
     There are several built-in queries:
    </p>
    <table>
     <tr><td>states</td><td>Defines all states.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>trans</td><td>Defines all transitions.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>runs(N)</td><td>Defines all runs of length N through the transition system.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
     More built-in queries are added if the action description is in nC+,
     as described below.
    </p>
    <h3>nC+</h3>
    <p>
     nC+ is described in the paper
     <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2007.06.007">Agent Strands in the Action Language nC+</a>.
     It is an extension of C+, used for representing and reasoning
     about norm-governed systems, often norm-governed agent systems.
     Syntactically, nC+ adds several new forms of law to C+ action
     description; the semantic effect of these new laws is to classify
     states, transitions, and agents' contributions to transitions as good
     or bad, licit or illicit, and so on---which we represent as a colouring
     of green and red. We stress: these laws do not change the structure of
     the labelled transition system, merely the deontic classification of
     its states and transitions.
    </p>
    <p>
     To <a href="./examples/emerson01">emerson01</a> we first add the
     state permission law:<br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notpermitted loc(thoreau)=walden if loc(A)=walden :- A \= thoreau.<br />
     <br />
     This means that if another agent is at Walden, it is bad for Thoreau
     to be there. State permission laws are written 'notpermitted F.', where
     'F' is a conjunction of atoms, or 'notpermitted F if G', where 'F' and
     'G' are conjunctions of atoms. 'F' must contain fluent constants only.
     Action permission laws have the same form but 'F' should contain action
     constants, not fluent constants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agent-specific permission laws are used to determine which behaviours
     of an agent are green or red. For agent-specific permission laws to be
     used, therefore, there should be a declaration of who the agents are;
     this is done in the source file using the predicate agent/1.
     Agent-specific permission laws then take the same form as action
     permission laws, with the name of the agent at the front. For example:
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agent(emerson).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agent(thoreau).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emerson notpermitted emerson^move=harvard & -(thoreau^move=harvard).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoreau notpermitted thoreau^writeTo^emerson if loc(thoreau)=walden.<br />
     <br />
     The first agent-specific law applies to Emerson, and states that if
     he moves to Harvard when Thoreau isn't moving to Harvard, then Emerson
     is doing something wrong. The second agent-specific permission law
     applies to Thoreau: Thoreau is acting badly whenever he writes to
     Emerson from Walden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Optionally, a 'local-global' coherence can be imposed on the norms.
     This means that whenever a transition is coloured red for a given
     agent (because of some agent-specific permission law), the transition
     is deemed to be red overall. This constraint is imposed by adding the
     fact<br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local_global.
     <br /><br />
     to the action description. The action description of nC+ that contains
     all these additions is in the file
     <a href="./examples/emerson02">emerson02</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>pC+</h3>
    <p>
     pC+ extends C+ for the representation of authorization and obligation
     policies, and policy composition using the language PBel. (For PBel,
     see
     <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1314436.1314439">A simple and expressive semantic framework for policy composition in access control</a>
     by Bruns, Dantas and Huth.) The language pC+, with implementation
     details and examples, is described in
     <a href="./pna.pdf">Policies, Norms and Actions</a> by Craven. (The 
     sample action descriptions referred to in that paper are here:
     <a href="./examples/pna01">pna01</a>,
     <a href="./examples/pna02">pna02</a>,
     <a href="./examples/pna03">pna03</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Using pC+ necessitates a slight change in the specification of
     signatures for action descriptions. Action constants are now divided
     into three categories. (i) Regular action constants, declared as usual
     using ac/1, which represent actions not controlled by policies.
     (ii) 'Permission action constants', declared in a similar way using
     pac/1, which represent actions controlled by authorization policies.
     (iii) 'Obligation action constants', declared using oblpac/1, which
     represent actions subject both to event-condition-action rules and
     authorization policies. (We will call action constants that fall into
     categories (ii) and (iii) 'policy action constants'.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Policy action constants should take the form 'S^X', where 'S' is the
     subject, who is performing some action 'X'. Typically 'X' itself
     has additional structure as 'A^T', where 'A' is the name of an action
     or operation that can be performed on a target 'T'. This extra
     structure is not necessary, however. The policy action constants in our
     example are specified as follows:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ac(A^move).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oblpac(A^writeTo^A1) :- A \= A1.<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(A^move, L).<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain(A^move, ff).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
     Policy action constants should generally not be declared as 'exogenous':
     whether or not the action is performed depends on whether the
     authorization policy in place allows a request for the action to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aside from adjustments to the signature, pC+ requires the addition of
     several new kinds of information in source files. First, there should be
     definitions of the basic policies: these are named policies consisting
     of either all positive authorization rules, or negative authorization
     rules. For example, here is a basic negative authorization policy,
     called 'pol':
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pol @ {<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denied(emerson^writeTo^thoreau) if loc(emerson)=harvard<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}.<br />
     <br />
     The law inside the curly brackets has a 'denied( )' constant in its
     head, and its body is a conjunction of atoms. If more than one law
     were included in a basic policy, this is written in the form:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pol2 @ {<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( denied(P1) if C1 :- B1 ),<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( denied(Pn) if Cn :- Bn )<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}.<br />
     <br />
     Positive authorization policies take the same form but with 'perm'
     in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Secondly, there should be a declaration of what the top policy is (this
     is the policy used by the PDP to evaluate access requests). The top
     policy is typically defined as a composition of other policies; the
     other policies may be basic, or themselves defined in terms of more
     policies. Here is how the top policy is declared in our example domain:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top ptop is (pol or (neg pol)).<br />
     <br />
     The name of the top policy is 'ptop', and it is defined, in terms of
     the policy 'pol', as 'pol or (neg pol)'.
    </p>
    <p>
     Definitions of other policies are made using expressions of the form
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy P is Comp.<br />
     <br />
     where 'P' is the name of a policy and 'Comp' is a policy composition
     expression, such as '(pol or (neg pol))', above. The names of negation,
     meet and join according to truth ordering are 'not', 'and', 'or'. The
     names of negation, meet and join according to the knowledge ordering
     are 'neg', 'meet' and 'join'. Binary operators are infix. (See
     <a href="">Policies, Norms and Actions</a> for more details on the
     language.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Optional abbreviations of new policy composition operators can be made
     using the predicate pol_abbrev/2. For example, the operator '&gt;', which
     we use often, is defined as:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pol_abbrev(X &gt; Y, X join ((neg (X join (not X))) meet Y) ).
     <br /><br />
     Obligation policies (interpreted as event-condition-action rules) are
     written straightforwardly as C+ action dynamic laws with the constant
     'obl( )' in the head. For example:
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused obl(emerson^writeTo^thoreau) if turbulent(emerson).
     <br /><br />
     Any action in an 'obl( )' constant must be declared as 'oblpac'.
    </p>
    <p>
     An optional fact
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pdp_transparent.
     <br /><br />
     in the source file means that constants representing the evaluation of
     all named policies will be included in the action description. Without
     this fact, only the overall decision for a request is represented.
    </p>
    <p>
     The file
     <a href="./examples/emerson03">emerson03</a> contains the causal laws,
     laws of nC+ (norms), and laws of pC+ (policies) mentioned so far.

    <h3>Transition System Visualization</h3>
    <p>
     To visualize the transition system defined by the action description,
     use
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- trans2dot.<br />
     <br />
     This will find all the states and transitions, write them as a .dot
     file, run <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> on the
     .dot file, and show the results using evince.
    </p>
    <p>
     The answers to individual queries can be visualized using q2dot/1 and
     q2dot/2. These take the same arguments as query/1 and query/2, but
     the solutions are written to a .dot file and then shown pictorially.
     The 'time' argument should always be 0 or 1 for visualized queries.

    <h3>Options and Other Utilities</h3>
    <p>
     There are various options that can be set and other utilities for
     inspecting the action description currently loaded in iCCalc or mcLUCA.
    </p>
    <p>
     Current values for options can be displayed by
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- options.<br />
     <br />
     A value of an option can be set using
     <br /><br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?- set_opt(OptionName, OptionValue).<br />
     <br />
     Information about the current action description can be shown using
     the following predicates.
    </p>
    <table>
     <tr><td>loadf/0</td><td>show information about the current file</td></tr>
     <tr><td>agents/0</td><td>prints currently specified agents</td></tr>
     <tr><td>signature/0</td><td>writes the signature to screen</td></tr>
     <tr><td>show_causal_laws/0</td><td>show the causal laws of the action description</td></tr>
     <tr><td>queries/0</td><td>writes all defined queries to screen</td></tr>
     <tr><td>info/0</td><td>does all of the above</td></tr>
