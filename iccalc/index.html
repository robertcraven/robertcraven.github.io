    <h3>iCCalc</h3>
    <p>
     iCCalc is an open-source Prolog program for various kinds of
     reasoning tasks using the action language C+. (For details of C+, see
     the paper
     <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/nmct.ps">Nonmonotonic
     Causal Theories</a> by Giunchiglia, Lee, Lifschitz, McCain and Turner.)
     C+ is a
     formalism for reasoning about the effects of actions on systems which
     evolve over time. C+ has very natural support for concurrent actions,
     various forms of default including default persistence, non-determinism,
     and other features of domains common in the literature on knowledge
     representation.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have made a number of additions to the C+ language, in order to enable
     a more convenient representation of deontic properties, multiple agents,
     policies, and interactions which are temporally distant. These additions
     are described in the papers:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2007.06.007">Agent Strands in the Action Language nC+</a>
         (Craven, Sergot)</li>
     <li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11786849_19">The Deontic Component of Action Language nC+</a>
         (Sergot, Craven)</li>
     <li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11225-005-0495-8">Distant Causation in C+</a>
         (Craven, Sergot)</li>
     <li><a href="./pna.pdf">Policies, Norms and Actions: Groundwork for a Framework</a> 
         (Craven)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Further additions to the language, in papers shortly to be published,
     provide support for policies; these are different from norms, as the
     examples we provide will illustrate.
    </p>
    <p>
     C+ was originally implemented using the 'Causal Calculator' CCalc. We
     have reimplemented it, adding support for all the language extensions
     referred to above, as well as a number of other features such as the
     visualization of labelled transition systems, a more powerful syntax for
     action description definitions, and the ability to be used in all main
     dialects of Prolog. Our new implementation is called iCCalc, and can
     be downloaded
     <a href="./download.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>mcLUCA</h3>
    <p>
     mcLUCA is a model-checker for properties of action and agency over
     transition systems specified in C+. The properties are expressed in
     the 'Logic of Unwitting Collective Agency'. This logic, known as LUCA,
     is described in the papers:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/research/technicalreports/2008/DTR08-6.pdf">The logic of unwitting collective agency</a>
         (Sergot)</li>
     <li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87654-0_1">Agency and Action in Norm-Governed Multi-agent Systems</a>
         (Sergot)</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>
     LUCA enables the expression of a number of different concepts of
     individual and collective agency, depending on the degree to which
     an agent contributes to bringing about some change. The implementation
     is also in Prolog and uses iCCalc. For information on mcLUCA and
     downloading it, email the authors.
