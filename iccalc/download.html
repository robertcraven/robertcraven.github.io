    <h2>Download</h2>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
     iCCalc and mcLUCA have been tested on
     <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Linux,
     and on Mac OS X (Leopard, Snow Leopard), but should also work
     on many other Unix-like OSs. We are currently developing a Windows
     version, which will be appearing very shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
     iCCalc and mcLUCA need two basic pieces of software: a version of Prolog
     and the SAT-solver clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     iCCalc and mcLUCA run under YAP Prolog, SICStus Prolog 4.1.1, and
     SICStus Prolog 3.12.3.
     <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/">YAP Prolog</a> is freely
     avaliable, and in our experience is much quicker than SICStus.
    </p>
    <p>
     The SAT-solver
     <a href="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/clasp/">clasp</a> is also
     freely available. The solver executable should be placed in the
     'solvers' directory for iCCalc. We have included clasp in the downloadable
     files for iCCalcc and mcLUCA.
    </p>
    <p>
     iCCalc includes the ability to visualize the labelled transition systems
     defined using C+ as an option. To do this, the graph-drawing suite
     <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> is needed. (This can
     also be obtained from the Ubuntu software centre, or installed using
     synaptic.) Transition systems are written to a postscript file and opened
     using a user-defined viewer (default evince).
    </p>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
     The current version of iCCalc is 3.1; the current version of mcLUCA is 1.0.
     The files for iCCalc are in the archive:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="iccalc3-1.tar.gz">iccalc3-1.tar.gz</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Unzip the archive, and place the script 'iccalc'
     from the 'scripts' directory somewhere in your PATH. The 'iccalc'
     script should be edited to point to the right directories; it should be
     obvious how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as the Prolog source, the download also contains a number of
     sample domains, with queries, to illustrate how iCCalc and mcLUCA
     can be used. These are more fully discussed in the
     <a href="./tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
